[Check out my sweet shop on Vercel!](https://nextjs-graphql-sweet-shop-4sell7ksn-natalies-projects-95e9cf97.vercel.app/)
## Getting started

```sh
cd client && npm i
```

## Start the app

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will do two things:

- Start a Next.js app running in development on <http://localhost:3000>
- Start a graphQL stub server running on <http://localhost:4000/graphql>

## Running tests

You can run tests from the client directory.

```sh
cd client && npm test
```
