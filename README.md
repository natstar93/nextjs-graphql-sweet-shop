## Getting started

```sh
cd client && npm i
```

## Start the app

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will do two things:

- Start a Next.js app running in development on <http://localhost:3000>
- Start a graphQL stub server running on <http://localhost:3001/graphql>

## Running tests

You can run tests from the client directory.

```sh
cd client && npm test
```
